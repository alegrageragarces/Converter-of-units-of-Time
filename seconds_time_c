/This is a program  that converts the number of Seconds given by the user into other units (days, hours, minutes and remaining seconds)

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

    int TotalSeconds;

   // We create the variables to store the remaining value of TotalSeconds after it has been converted into other units

    int days, hours, minutes, seconds;
    
    printf("Enter the number of seconds: ");

    // Assign the number of seconds entered by the user to the variable TotalSeconds
    scanf("%d", &TotalSeconds);

    days = TotalSeconds / 86400;

    // Change the value of SegundosIntroducidos to the remainder after converting seconds to days
    TotalSeconds = TotalSeconds % 86400;

    hours = TotalSeconds / 3600;
    TotalSeconds = TotalSeconds % 3600;

    minutes = TotalSeconds / 60;

    // The final remainder from all the previous conversions represents the remaining number of seconds
    seconds = TotalSeconds % 60;

    printf("The number of seconds entered is equivalent to: %d days, %d hours, %d minutes, %d seconds", days, hours, minutes, seconds);
